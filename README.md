# ASP.NET Core MVC Basics

In this repository, I regularly share all the fundamental and essential topics in ASP.NET Core MVC with practical examples. It includes examples of **data transfer between controller and view**, **routing**, **layouts**, **partial views**, **basic LINQ queries** and more.

When you run the application, the homepage contains the links to all the shared topics. You can access the examples for any topic directly from the homepage.

I have also covered all the methods and topics used here in detail on my Medium page. You can access all my articles here: [medium.com/@nihatydin](https://medium.com/@nihatydin)
